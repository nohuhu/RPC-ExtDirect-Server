RPC::ExtDirect::Server
======================

    This module implements a minimal Ext.Direct capable server in pure Perl.
    Its main purpose is to be used as a lightweight drop-in replacement for
    more complex production environments like Plack or Apache/mod_perl, e.g.
    for testing and mockups.

    It can also be used successfully as the basis for production application
    servers when feature richness is not a requirement, or when backwards
    compatibility is the primary concern. Another possible application for
    RPC::ExtDirect::Server is embedded systems; due to its small footprint
    and pure Perl dependencies it can be used easily in resource constrained
    platforms.

    Finally, many legacy computing systems can be retrofitted with modern
    HTML5 Web interface applications with Ext.Direct back end built on top
    of RPC::ExtDirect::Server; it is compatible with (and is tested
    against!) Perl 5.6 and newer.
